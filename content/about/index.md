Hello! Interestingly, I started learning programming in my first year at [Riara University,  Nairobi,Kenya](https://www.riarauniversity.ac.ke) where I did Computer Science in (2017-2021).
I later enrolled for a Software Engineering bootcamp at **ALX AFRICA** in (2021-2022) and then enrolled for DevOps Engineer Nanodegree from **UDACITY**. 

I design, build and deploy software  everything I make starts with you. I create the products you tell me you wish existed. I believe in thoughtful design, and enabling conversation. But most of all, I believe that creating solutions is about having fun, wherever we are in our journey.

It's nice to meet you! Take a peek around the area now that you are here. Please have a look at my work and let me know what you think.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
