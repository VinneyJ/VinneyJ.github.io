Hello! Interestingly, I started learning programming in my first year at [Riara University,  Nairobi,Kenya](https://www.riarauniversity.ac.ke) where I did Computer Science in (2017-2021).
I later enrolled for a Software Engineering bootcamp at **ALX AFRICA** in (2021-2022) and then enrolled for DevOps Engineer Nanodegree from **UDACITY**. 


I have been awarded as Winner in [Innovation Nugget](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PzTZkXlQV9ldZxqmBbbO94uIqrhSwvcq/view?usp=sharing), Creativity Jam, [Design Thinking Hackathon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXCATvKwzHCvctHtElsqFg5YIqabz22O/view?usp=sharing) and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exB19OoQ5dzU2mg4qbdkNutA25TGBWV3/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
