I was motivated to work on this project by the fact that anytime I looked for a house to live in, It becomes hard to work with agents because some of the are out to scam people. So this platform provides license to agents. This gives clients some faith. I intend to make it safe and valuable to both parties.
On this platform, agents can list properties and the can be rated...Users can buy properties, comment about the properties and rate agents.
