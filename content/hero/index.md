I am a young software engineer passionate about building innovative systems that improve company efficiency and effectiveness.

Currently working as a Back-end Developer at [Skylux Tech]() and as a volunteer Software Engineer at [Machini Technologies]().


Outside my normal work, I occasionally blog on [Medium](https://vincent-otieno.medium.com/) and [Memories](https://itsvince.me/pensive).
